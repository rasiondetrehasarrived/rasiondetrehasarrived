uh hi im not adding any images.

**info!** 
- im under 18.

- usually semi-verbal if not with friends. possibly not verbal at all if im frustrated, and i do get frustrated VERY easily unless if i know who you are and how you'd act.
  
- i go idle and offtab a lot. this means i will have a delay in everything, and possibly not reply or move for long periods of time. please give me time to get back on the tab where we were talking.
  
- always ask for ships to int or to become friends. before that, interact with care. i may be sensitive to strangers.

- i may make inappropriate gestures or jokes. if you are not comfortable with that, please always tell me. i can stop those jokes or tone it down. i heavily apologize if i do make you uncomfortable with troll skins, as i dont use them often.

  *cosplay info â€¦*

; usually, i use forsaken, pwned by 14:00, dandys world, dream game, vocaloid, blocktales, and many other cosplays in pony town. areas to find me are in the fnaf area with friends or in the crowed forsaken/roblox area below the cafe. i always avoid going to the library. if we are friends, i may be at islamd a lot.

dont be shy to tell me of what cosplays to make. im always open to make more cosplays. but please, dont make too many jokes of how many unfinished cosplays i have unless if we are VERY close. i do not have the motivation to finish them.
