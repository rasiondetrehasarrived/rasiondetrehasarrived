uh hi im not adding any images, get ready for a yapping session. elephant sfx

**info!** 
- im under 18 and very, very vauge about my age.

- i have a boyfriwnd,, girlfriend,,, idk what to call them...

- usually semi-verbal if not with friends. possibly not verbal at all if im frustrated, and i do get frustrated VERY easily unless if i know who you are and how you'd act.
  
- i go idle and offtab a lot. this means i will have a delay in everything, and possibly not reply or move for long periods of time. please give me time to get back on the tab where we were talking.
  
- always ask for ships to int or to become friends. before that, interact with care. i may be sensitive to strangers.

- i may make inappropriate gestures or jokes. if you are not comfortable with that, please always tell me. i can stop those jokes or tone it down. i heavily apologize if i do make you uncomfortable with troll skins, as i dont mean to come off as weird (too much.) i use troll skins when talking to friends only.

- i make many typing mistakes and dont appreciate jokes or actually being corrected about it unless i ask or you are a close friend of mine !

  
heavily directed to pony town,
- its time i specify since now im usually nonverbal, i kiss cosplays as compliments or praise! i dont mean to come off as weird, i just wanna tell you your cosplay/oc is pretty without chatting!

dont be shy to tell me of what cosplays to make. im always open to make more cosplays. but please, dont make too many jokes of how many unfinished cosplays i have unless if we are VERY close. i do not have the motivation to finish them.

  - dni is people over 18, exaggerating proshippers/darkshippers and yumeshippers (like when they are so obvious and romanticize like everything), MAPs, roleplayers, and basic dni.

; on edge for dni : objectums, dandys world fandom, tadc fandom, and those who are very (i mean VERY) dirty minded . all listed are meant to iwec and not get too close with me. i will specify if im fine with you. ^_^
